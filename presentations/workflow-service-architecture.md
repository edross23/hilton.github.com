Reactive application development gives us better ways to build scalable applications, but often together with a micro-services jigsaw puzzle.
Decoupled teams can rapidly deliver decoupled services, but you still need to piece together an end-to-end system.
This presentation introduces an alternative way to think about and architect reactive applications using workflow tools.

Modern workflow management tools enable a convenient process-oriented approach to service orchestration that is itself reactive.
More importantly, process management technology provides two key features that hand-coded applications typically lack:
persistent execution state and an editable graphical process representation that you can use to define and adjust service orchestration.
After learning how to coordinate micro-services, you will also and how to use the same system to orchestrate micro-service-like human workers.
It turns out that with the right platform, human actors can also be reactive services, and participate in the same architecture.
