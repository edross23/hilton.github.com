In Europe, many software developers work in English, on international teams.
The resulting Euro-English dialect works surprisingly well, much to the annoyance of native English speakers.
What’s less obvious are the subtle ways that Euro-English can introduce both software and development process bugs.

This talk introduces language-related software development gotchas that have little to do with how good your English is.
You’ll learn what ‘business English’ is for, whether to translate domain model terms into English, and what you should do about ‘trainings’ not being a proper English word.
You’ll also become equipped to recognise previously invisible problems, and new ways for your whole team to improve.
