Scaling web applications is usually about runtime performance for high-traffic consumer applications. This talk is about a different kind of scaling: architectures that increase development speed for business applications. Using Play and Scala for something that would be easy to build with PHP is like going for a drive in a Rolls Royce: it’s so smooth that you don’t realise how fast you’re going.

Two case studies of commercial projects illustrate using Play and Scala to complete development so easily it feels like cheating. Both projects used Play, Scala, Slick, Bootstrap and minimal JavaScript or front-end development. The lessons learned from these projects show how this architecture makes trade-offs between development cost and complexity. Best of all, there wasn’t any PHP at all.
