Modern languages’ biggest problem isn’t having enough cool features, it’s unmaintainable code. 
The core of maintainable code is clean code with good tests, but that by itself is not enough. 
This workshop introduces a range of techniques for writing and improving code for maintainability, including recognising bad code, how to get better at naming, and the few code comments you actually need.

This workshop is for software developers that work on successful software that isn’t thrown away before it reaches five years old. 
Attendees will learn the difference between average code and good code that won’t have to be thrown away because no-one understands it any more.
