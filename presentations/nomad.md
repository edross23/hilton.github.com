This is the story of how I chose a job and work assignments that got me all sorts of things for free. My first business trips introduced me to eating out every day, living in a hotel, moving countries and exploring new cities.

What started as standard university student behaviour soon became an expense claims habit, and an ongoing challenge to do new things on OPM (other peopleâ€™s money). While I was at it, I claimed all kinds of personal freedoms as well, escaping the tyranny of personal possessions, social obligations and the horror of living in the same place for more than a few weeks or months at a time.

After 20 years, 12 countries, and more expense claims than you've had hot dinners, it turns out that I got a lot more out of this than just free stuff. Ironically, my expense claim habit gave me experiences that made me successful in the career that facilitated it. It also gave me plenty of stories to tell.
