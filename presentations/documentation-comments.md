title: Write one-sentence documentation comments
description: One of 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know
layout: speaking
---

You’re probably either writing too many comments in your code, or none at all.
Meanwhile, comments are amazingly useful, if they’re good, mainly because we spend more time reading code than writing it.
This presentation gives specific actionable advice on how to write useful comments,
while also starting a discussion about what it means to document code properly.
(Talking about code comments always starts a discussion.)

Programmers don’t have access to enough good advice about how to write code.
The craft suffers when software developers rely on too few voices in too few books.
_97 Things Every Programmer Should Know_ 
([book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/),
[full text](https://github.com/97-things/97-things-every-programmer-should-know))
improved on previous books by introducing specific advice from many practitioners.
This presentation covers one of Peter Hilton’s published contributions from the follow-up book,
[97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048824.do).
