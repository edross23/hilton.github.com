<!-- 
1. ‘value proposition’ is a standard term; product people mostly agree about what it means.
2. Existing customers may articulate your product’s value to them.
3. Prospects might recognise this value and insist that you sell it to them.
4. You don’t create the value proposition; you discover and identify it.
-->

After writing a [product definition](product-definition) and a 
[product pitch](product-pitch), you can take on a more difficult task:
discovering, identifying, and writing your product’s _value proposition_.
These tasks’ difficulty comes from the term’s imprecision, which Christopher Locke lampoons in his book _Gonzo Marketing_:

> Business in general, and marketing in particular, seem to assume we know what they mean when they sling around terms like _value, brand_ and _positioning_, and equate the resulting blur of vague ideas to something we might actually care about.

Fortunately, _most_ product people agree on what _value_ means, and why you should care.
In _Product Management for Dummies_, Brian Lawley & Pamela Schure give a typical definition:

> **Value proposition.**
> A statement of the value that your product brings to your customer. 
> The main reason that a customer should buy from you.

The value proposition therefore describes the three-way relationship between customers, your product, and the value the product gives those customers.
In _Crossing the Chasm_, Geoffrey More makes this more explicit.

> The value triad is made up of three components: the product itself, the target customer, and the target application.
> The three taken together make up a value proposition, something one can sell.
> That is, an eggbeater, a cook, and the baking of a cake combine to create a value proposition called ‘saving time and energy,’ which can be used to sell the eggbeater to the cake maker.

## Learn from customers and prospects

> Use customer visits to learn ‘how your product is valued by different customer types’, and for ‘the discovery of possible problems where posed value propositions don’t align with customer expectations’.
