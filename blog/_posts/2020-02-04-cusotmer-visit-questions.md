As a product manager, you need to talk to your customers to understand their problems, ideally face-to-face.
Despite the time they take, customer visits give you highly valuable insights.
To start with, customer visits can help you discover your product’s value proposition.

The more customer visits you do, the more techniques you will learn and use, to get more and better insights.
Learning starts with listening, but that can lead to awkward silences if your customer is expecting you to run the meeting.
In that case, some default open questions can help to get your customer talking.
Try the following questions for discovering your product’s value proposition.

## 1. What business problem do you intend to solve?

For your first challenge, you need to get your customer talking about their problems, which will teach you more than a discussion about their software features wish list.
Several things can make this difficult, so you may need to approach this question indirectly.

First, your customer might be more comfortable talking about something concrete than starting with an abstract question.
You can ask about what their current work involves, before asking them to place that in a broader context, so you can ‘better understand their business’.
Most people love talking about what they do, which generally helps.

Second, your customer might already have a list of features they want in your product, or even a spreadsheet with far too many columns.
If they want to go through this list, then you will probably fail to switch the agenda to open questions about their problems.
Instead, you will likely have more success by first listening to and acknowledging their ideas, and using them as the basis for a conversation about which problems those ideas address.

## 2. What did you use before using our product? 

Asking customers about their current or previous solution helps you understand their business problem from another angle.
You can test whether you understand the problem by checking that you understand the prior alternative.

Talking about the previous solution lets you ask a follow-on question: why did you switch? Understanding what the customer didn’t like about someone else’s product can point to why they prefer yours.

## 3. Why did you select our product?

Asking your customer why they chose your product verges on asking them to articulate its value proposition directly.
You can expect a lot of variety among answers to this question, including the occasional revealing insight.

Look for opportunities to dig into your customer’s reasons.
You’ll learn more about your customer’s goals than about your product, if they tell you what they care about, but also the relationship between these goals and your product, i.e. the value proposition itself.
You can also ask why a few more times, to reveal choices’ root causes.

## 4. Does our product satisfy your expectations?

The final questions test the difference between the promise that led your customer to your product, and the reality of their experience with your product.
If you discover an unsatisfied customer, you may have discovered a value proposition that doesn’t work.
Happy customers, on the other hand, merely confirm what you already learned from the previous questions.

## 5. What would make you more successful?

The last question is the first that looks to the future, which invites less useful speculation, but can also offer insight into gaps in your value proposition, or in your product’s ability to achieve it.
Asking what would make solving a problem with your product more successful might only start a feature discussion, but may also identify a customer who only likes your product because they hated the previous solution more.

In the end, these questions give you several ways to approach the core questions that a value proposition answers: 	who will buy your product, and what value will they get from doing so?
