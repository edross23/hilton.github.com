The tyranny of traditional text-based coding will gradually lose ground to visual no-code automation.
This starts with unsophisticated business applications for editing and publishing information, submitting and approving requests, tracking an issue or a project, and everything else that replaces what a smaller or earlier version of the company used spreadsheets for.

Gradual erosion happens each time someone automates one of these activities using a visual tool, instead of hiring someone else to write code.
Part of the erosion of coding problems occurs when more people discover a problem that you donâ€™t need to write code to solve.
To let people submit requests, for example, you can start with Google Forms for the simple examples but also progress to more sophisticated software for more complex scenarios.

Coding problem erosion also happens when a product like Google Forms first appears, popularising a software category dedicated to making a specific problem easier to solve.
What happens next follows a predictable pattern.

<h2 id="ignore">First they ignore you</h2>

People who write code on enterprise IT projects donâ€™t generally talk about no-code automation, which usually doesnâ€™t target what they implement.
Google Forms doesnâ€™t (at the time of writing) help automatically handle requests, it just collects the data without processing it.
But how many developers pay attention to the latest products that do more than that?

In practice, people involved in traditional automation - not only the programmers - have no reason to pay attention to alternative approaches, just as a carpenter who makes wooden chairs might ignore developments in [3D-printed furniture](https://ultimaker.com/learn/3d-printing-in-furniture-design).


<h2 id="laugh">Then they laugh at you</h2>

Occasionally, people write about why they think that no-code automation â€˜will never workâ€™, which looks at least a little like ridicule.

* [The camunda Hypothesis](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2013/04/the-camunda-hypothesis/) (2013) - â€˜zero code might work, just not around hereâ€™ (paraphrasing)
* [The 'No Code' Delusion](https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/) (2020) - â€˜What did no-code ever do for us?â€™ (paraphrasing again)
* [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode) (Kelsey Hightower, 2018) - â€˜Write nothing; deploy nowhereâ€™ ðŸ˜‚

They probably wouldnâ€™t bother if their business model didnâ€™t depend on their customers not adopting no-code automation.

<h2 id="fight">Then they fight you</h2>

We havenâ€™t seen any serious attacks on no-code automation yet.
In the near future, large numbers of failed Robotic Process Automation (RPA) implementations may provide easy targets.
Large RPA implementation budgets certainly attract attention.

No-one needs to â€˜fight backâ€™, though, what ever that might mean.
Instead, people will continue to discover where and how to get more value from no-code solutions.

Ironically, in an attempt to defend itself from heretical alternatives, traditional programming communities may _close ranks_, and thereby exacerbate the gatekeeping that no-code automation (partly) exists to solve, by creating something accessible to a wider audience.

<h2 id="win">Then you win</h2>

No-code automation will find its place, the market will consolidate around one or more new product categories, and product prices will fall.
[Microsoft Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/)â€™s existence guarantees it.

No-code automation wonâ€™t replace anything, but will establish more choice, and take a piece of existing software markets.
And no-code automation will have _won_ when software developers know which code they shouldnâ€™t write, so they can work on more interesting problems instead.
