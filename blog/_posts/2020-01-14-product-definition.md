<!-- 
1. Articulate the product definition to set the context for talking about your product
2. Include three things in your product definition: one sentence description, the audience, and what they can do.
3. Say who you built the product for
4. Highlight what the product does for those people
5. The product definition is like the set-up for a joke. The value proposition is the punchline.
