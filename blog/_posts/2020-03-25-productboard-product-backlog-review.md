[productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) - a SaaS product management web application - lets you manage product backlogs, customer feedback, roadmaps and customer portals.
This review focuses on productboard’s functionality for managing the product backlog;
the other parts of the application (not covered in this review) use the same data.

In productboard, the product backlog is a list of _features_, arranged into a hierarchy of _products, components, features_ and _sub-features._
On the _features board_, you create multiple filtered feature views, displayed as a hierarchy, sorted list, grouped by release or status, or as a two-dimensional _matrix_.


## What I like about productboard

After using productboard daily for more than six months, I still find a lot to like about productboard.

*Onboarding people* went smoothly, thanks to Google GSuite single sign-on.
Within the application settings, I find it easy enough to modify user roles and deactivate users.

*Migrating data* also went well, via a nicely-designed option to paste in a list of features from a spreadsheet, with multiple columns, which I already had.
After that, bulk editing features made it easy enough to organise my list.

*Hierarchical organisation*: I found this useful at the top level, to separate products in a product portfolio, and at the bottom level, to add _sub-features_ for the actual product development epics.
However, I haven’t needed the intermediate product _components_ and the user interface for selecting hierarchy levels seems clunky at times.
*Tagging* enables additional classification.

*Search*: I use this every day to find features, and generally find what I want.
However, as the number of features grows, I have started to miss more fuzzy matching, to help me avoid entering duplicate features.
The search query filters the list, rather than showing a separate search results page, which works but does miss some standard search functionality, such as showing the number of search results.

*Saved views* provide a useful way to switch between and share different views of the product backlog.
I use this to have filtered backlogs showing upcoming work, or specific product development initiatives.

*GitHub and Jira integration*, with two-way feature synchronisation, helps us work with with Engineering teams that use different tools for planned development work.

Other features I find helpful include a modification history, customisable statuses, and uncomplicated formatting in the feature description.
I also appreciate the helpful on-line support and good-enough documentation, which have resolved my product questions.


## What I don’t like about productboard

In the last six months, I have found plenty of things not to like about productboard.

* Naming the product backlog items _features_ annoys me, because it makes people think about the solution space, rather than business problems.
* I miss complex search, e.g. to list features without a specific tag.
* The user-interface is all kinds of over-engineered and is full of moving parts that break normal interaction using scrollbars and the keyboard, and don’t work at all on mobile browsers.
* Email notifications don’t include any context for what changed, and include my own changes, making them mostly useless.
* The competitors feature doesn’t seem to make sense, and certainly doesn’t support meaningful competitive analysis.
* Feature description formatting doesn’t support hyperlinks, only clickable URLs.


## Conclusion

Good, but overly-complex and expensive.
