_Lead with the benefits_ - standard product marketing advice - doesn’t justify coyness about what you actually sell.
This advice suggests talking about product benefits before you talk about price, but assumes that you’ve already established what the product _is_.
Without a clear product definition, your story parallels a comedy sketch in a restaurant:

<blockquote class="big" style="max-width:32em">
<p>diner: what’s today’s special?</p>
<p>waiter: you’ll love it!</p>
<p>diner (annoyed): but what <em>is</em> it?</p>
</blockquote>

This may seem contrived, but reflects the poor state of some product descriptions, notably for enterprise software products.

## Don’t lead with context-free benefits

The first sentence on the [Siebel Sales](https://www.oracle.com/applications/siebel/products/sales/) product page leaves you guessing about what kind of product it’s talking about:

> Designed to improve pipeline visibility, sales effectiveness, and bottom-line results, Siebel Sales enables your organization to share information across teams. Oracle's Siebel Sales is fully integrated with the entire Siebel product family—enabling flexible, phased deployments for constantly changing and growing companies.

Salesforce’s
[What is Salesforce?](https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/) 
page does better by starting with a product definition:

> Salesforce is a customer relationship management solution that brings companies and customers together. It's one integrated CRM platform that gives all your departments — including marketing, sales, commerce, and service — a single, shared view of every customer.

Your product needs a straightforward written product definition, for context.
Start with one sentence.

## Introduce the product in one sentence

[A product’s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM) 
often starts with a better concise one-sentence description than its own web site:

> Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a customer relationship management software package developed by Microsoft.

In general, if you can’t start your product definition with a one-sentence description, you have a problem worth solving.
As with other writing problems, you can find plenty of examples to learn from:

> The CRM that just works.
> ([Nutshell](https://www.nutshell.com))
>
> Zendesk Sell (formerly Base) is sales force automation software to enhance productivity, processes, and pipeline visibility for sales teams.
> ([Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/sell/))
>
> The smart simple online CRM.
> ([Capsule](https://capsulecrm.com))
>
> The sales CRM that makes your life easy, so all you have to do is sell.
> ([Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com))
>
> Web based CRM, project management & collaboration.
> ([WORKetc](https://www.worketc.com))


Your product marketing story needs a _protagonist_ to save the day.
A good novel introduces the protagonist to get the plot moving, without telling their life story on the first page.
Your product plays the protagonist in the marketing story, and the product definition introduces the product at the start.

You need a clear product definition for more than product marketing: even the smallest organisation has room for internal confusion about its own products.

## Name existing product categories

The examples above mention _customer relationship management (CRM) software_.
This doesn’t tell the whole story, but it narrows the focus: _CRM_ explains more than any other single word.
Within your product definition’s first sentence or two, identify existing categories that your product belongs to.

As a rule, an existing _category_ has a Wikipedia page, such as 
[Customer relationship management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management).
As with CRM, the same term often applies to both a business software category and a management discipline.

You’ll have some difficulty if your product doesn’t fit an established category.
In this case, you’ll need more words: start with the closest one or two categories, and clarify.

## Claim the unremarkable, highlight the twist

Use the product definition to get the unremarkable aspects of your product out of the way, before you get on to its unique qualities.
If you build _CRM SaaS for investment banks_ then it’s helpful to say so, even though other products share those categories.

Sometimes a product definition story has a twist: a unique part of the combination.
Perhaps only your _CRM SaaS for investment banks_ offers _offline mobile support_ or installation as a 
[pre-installed appliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_appliance).

## Use the same definition in your product stories

A good one or two sentence product definition requires effort and iteration, but also delivers a lot of value.
If you get this right, you can introduce your product consistently in every story you tell.
Otherwise, correcting the resulting misunderstandings will cost more effort.
