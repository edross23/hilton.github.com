At first glance, The Joker appears to be just another small bar, and nothing special. In fact, we only ended up there the first time because <a href="kulminator">Kulminator</a> was closed. However, The Joker turned out to be a pretty good small bar for a drink, with good music and atmosphere despite it being mostly empty so early in the evening.

We have not tried this place on a comedy night, or when there was a DJ, so we probably missed out on something more special. This place is certainly worth a second look.
