summary: Decent cafe, only made more cool by having its own Camper shoe shop

<p>Although it is always something of a gimmick, there is something cool about a cafe that is combined with something else, such as a bookshop or gallery. In this case, Cafe Theo has its very own <a href="http://www.camper.com/">Camper</a> shoe shop. The cafe itself is good, though cramped, and is a good place for a coffee break during a shopping expedition.</p>

<p>The decor is smart and modern, with a red theme that matches the Camper brand. There is also a decent terrace, although we tend to visit Antwerp when it is too cold to sit outside, so we have not tried it.</p>
