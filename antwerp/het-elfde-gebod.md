<p>There are so many cafes and restaurants in the tourist-centre of Antwerp, between Groenplaats and Grote Markt that it is hard to imagine that any of them are any good; Het Elfde Gebod (whose web site suggests that it has been renamed to KathedraalCafe) is one of the good ones. It is a fairly large cafe with a traditional interior, a nice big terrace, and a decent selection of food and beer. None of these things are really special, but they are certainly above-average.</p>

<p>The main peculiarity is the enormous collection of statuettes of angels that line the interior walls, which certainly add to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The best ways to enjoy this cafe are out on the terrace for lunch on a sunny day, with a large lunch and a beer, or for a relaxed evening with a large number of beers and something to eat.</p>
