<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>Peter started writing in 1996, to provide content for his first web site when he started experimenting with web technology. This was back in the days when web pages had transparent backgrounds and you could see the grey metal of the web browser behind the text. His early work focused on cafe and restaurant reviews, written during a period of travel and working overseas, punctuated by periods of idleness and reading books in cafes.</p>

<p>Peter developed an interest in technical writing during his work as an IT consultant, leading to what some might call a perverse appreciation for the joy of software project documentation. Meanwhile, he specialised as a web application developer, reading all of the W3C specifications of the time and applying their ideas to business application software.</p>

<p>In 2004, Peter joined Lunatech Research in Rotterdam and published technical writing for the first time. The next five years saw a stream of articles on the company blog (http://blog.lunatech.com/) mostly technical, but occasionally straying into other areas, including project management and cocktail recipes. Meanwhile, Peter was using Java-based open-source stacks to build enterprise web applications: it was only a matter of time before technical writing, project documentation would lead to writing documentation for open-source frameworks.</p>

<p>Peter started writing about the Play framework in 2010, first on the Lunatech blog and later by making direct contributions to the framework’s official documentation as a committer. In the beginning of 2012, the Play 2.0 release brought more contributors to the open source project, notably from Typesafe, at which point Peter shifted his focus to working on his first book.</p>
